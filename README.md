Scala reinforcement learning framework

This is code I'm using to play around with different reinforcement learning and n-armed bandit algorithms.
I'm also using it to mess around with Dotty/Scala 3. Someone else might find it useful. I plan to work through 
Barto and Sutton's book using this library and repository.

For now I have the Breeze jars committed to the repo because I had to compile them with my version of the JVM 
to get them to work. I'll try to fix that at some point. Feel free to add issues or open PRs. Though I don't 
have a formal process in place right now.
